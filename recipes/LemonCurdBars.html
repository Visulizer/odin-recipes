    <h1>My Lemon Curd Bars</h1>

    <div>
    <p>These lemon bars with lemon curd are sweet and tangy. They are delicious with a crunchy crust and they are so easy to make! As lemon desserts are my favorite,  it is time to share another recipe with lemon.  I am sharing with you my lemon curd bars.  Have you tried my lemon curd?  It is tangy,  silky and so delicious that I love eating it from a jar with a spoon so much.
